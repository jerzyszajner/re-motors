# Porsche Project - Educational Website

This project is a frontend design demonstration created as part of my learning journey in web development. It was developed in collaboration with a fellow student from the workshop and interaction design students to showcase our skills in HTML, CSS, and responsive design.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS (Flexbox, Grid)
- Responsive design techniques

## Project Description
The website is designed as a mock landing page for Porsche. It includes images and design elements that demonstrate key frontend skills, focusing on layout and styling.

### Note on Images and Copyright
Images used in this project are owned by Porsche and were sourced from the official [Porsche 911 Targa 4 GTS page](https://www.porsche.com/norway/no/models/911/targa-models/911-targa-4-gts/).
